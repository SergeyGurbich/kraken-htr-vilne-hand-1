# Model Card: Kraken HTR â€” Vilne Yiddish Hand 1

## ðŸ”¸ Model version 1.8: `vilne_yiddish_8a.mlmodel`
Currently the most advanced model within this series

### Summary

Fine-tuned continuation of previous versions, with an additional handwriting style from the same historical context.  

Ground truth data consists mainly of authobiografic manuscripts written in Vilnius, Grodno, Turov and Wloclawek in 1933-1939.

### Training Set Size
Pages: 308
Lines: 5822
Words: 63449
Characters: 359604 

### Training Data

- Source: Manuscript scans from interwar Vilnius (private dataset).
- Script: Hebrew/Yiddish (Ashkenazi cursive style).
- Annotation format: PAGE XML (transcription level: accurate, line-based).

Accuracy (character-level): 95.5% (validation)

### Notes  
The vast majority of recognition errors are related to the confusion of yud and vav, which are almost indistinguishable in most handwritings from GT

## ðŸ”¸ Model version 1.1: `vilne_yiddish_1.mlmodel`

### Summary

This model was trained using Kraken (v5.3.0) on Yiddish manuscript material written in Hebrew script. The training data derives from a single handwriting style found in interwar Vilnius. The model achieves 93.1% character accuracy and is intended as a baseline for further fine-tuning on related sources from Eastern Europe.

### Intended Use

- **Use cases**: OCR for Yiddish handwritten sources, research in Jewish history, archival processing, and paleography.
- **Users**: Digital humanists, historians, archivists, library professionals.
- **Recommended environments**: Kraken CLI, eScriptorium platform.

### Training Data

- Source: Manuscript scans from interwar Vilnius (private dataset).
- Script: Hebrew/Yiddish (Ashkenazi cursive style).
- Annotation format: PAGE XML (transcription level: accurate, line-based).
- Data license: Not publicly released; see repository notes.

### Training Details

- Kraken version: 5.3.0
- Total epochs: 25 (5 + 15 + 5)
- Learning rate: staged (default â†’ 0.0005 â†’ 0.0001)
- Accuracy: 93.1% (character-level, validation set)
- Device: CPU
- Training tool: Kraken train (binary format, padding and augmentation enabled)

### Limitations

- Trained on a single handwriting style.
- Best results on materials similar in layout, resolution, and script.
- Not evaluated on mixed-script or printed text.
- May fail on modern Yiddish handwriting or Sephardic styles.
