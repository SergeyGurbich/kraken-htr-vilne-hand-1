# Model Card: Kraken HTR â€” Vilne Yiddish Hand 1

## ðŸ”¸ Model version 2: `vilne_yiddish_2.mlmodel`

### Summary

Fine-tuned continuation of version 1, with an additional handwriting style from the same historical context.  
This model aims to improve generalizability across styles found in interwar Yiddish documents.

### Training Details

- Based on: `vilne_yiddish_1.mlmodel`  
- Kraken version: 5.3.0  
- Epochs: +18 (15 + 3, staged learning rates)  
- Accuracy (character-level): 92.0% (validation)  
- Additional data: Second handwriting style added for fine-tuning  
- Annotation format: PAGE XML  

### Notes

While slightly lower in accuracy than version 1 (due to broader variability), this model may perform better across different sources and less "clean" handwriting.

## ðŸ”¸ Model version 1: `vilne_yiddish_1.mlmodel`

### Summary

This model was trained using Kraken (v5.3.0) on Yiddish manuscript material written in Hebrew script. The training data derives from a single handwriting style found in interwar Vilnius. The model achieves 93.1% character accuracy and is intended as a baseline for further fine-tuning on related sources from Eastern Europe.

### Intended Use

- **Use cases**: OCR for Yiddish handwritten sources, research in Jewish history, archival processing, and paleography.
- **Users**: Digital humanists, historians, archivists, library professionals.
- **Recommended environments**: Kraken CLI, eScriptorium platform.

### Training Data

- Source: Manuscript scans from interwar Vilnius (private dataset).
- Script: Hebrew/Yiddish (Ashkenazi cursive style).
- Annotation format: PAGE XML (transcription level: accurate, line-based).
- Data license: Not publicly released; see repository notes.

### Training Details

- Kraken version: 5.3.0
- Total epochs: 25 (5 + 15 + 5)
- Learning rate: staged (default â†’ 0.0005 â†’ 0.0001)
- Accuracy: 93.1% (character-level, validation set)
- Device: CPU
- Training tool: Kraken train (binary format, padding and augmentation enabled)

### Limitations

- Trained on a single handwriting style.
- Best results on materials similar in layout, resolution, and script.
- Not evaluated on mixed-script or printed text.
- May fail on modern Yiddish handwriting or Sephardic styles.
